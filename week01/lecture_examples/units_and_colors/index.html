      <h1>Let's discuss units and colors</h1>

      <p>Units and colors are an important part of web design. Units are used to define the size of elements on the page, while colors are used to define the visual appearance of those elements.</p>

      <p>There are many different units that can be used in web design. <span>This is a test.</span> The main <strong>absolute</strong> unit that you use on the web is pixels. <strong>Relative</strong> units include em and rem, which are relative to the font size, vw and vh, which are relative to the browser viewport size, and percentages, which are relative the corresponding size on the parent element. Each unit has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it's important to choose the right unit for the job.</p>

      <p>Colors can be defined using a variety of methods, such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hex-color">hex codes</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/rgb">rgb values</a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color">named colors</a>. Often, the type of definition you use is a matter of personal preference. named colors and hex codes are the most common, but mainly because they are the oldest and most widely supported. I find rgb values to be easier to think about.</p>
