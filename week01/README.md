* Part 1, Chapter 3 -- Code quality
  - Please note that **section 3.4** is intended to be ironic; do not be a ninja!
  - **Section 3.5** talks about tests with Mocha. I tend to use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), but Mocha is also a good choice. Either way, while we won't be writing many tests in this course, it's good background.
  - **Section 3.6** is also good background, but we won't worry much about transpilers in this course.
