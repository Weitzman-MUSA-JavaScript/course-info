# Critiquing Accessibility

1.  Keep the WCAG criteria in mind
    * Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust
2.  Try your task on a computer as a sighted user that can use a mouse
    * Even with full sight and dexterity, sites can struggle to be understandable, especially if English is not the user’s first language
3.  Try your task without using the mouse
    * On an operable site, you should be able to do what you need using the tab key
4.  Try your task on a mobile device
    * This can surface issues with robustness
5.  Try your task with colorblindness simulators and screen readers
    * Exercise the site’s perceivability; try even using the screen reader with your eyes closed
