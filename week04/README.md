## Practice

In this exercise you'll build on the choropleth map that you created in the previous class. Imagine that the map is a part of a dashboard that you are creating for the commonwealth's election commission. They want users to be able to not just see the data on the map, but also to be able to click on a given county and see more detailed information about the election results (such as a chart showing the distribution of votes for different candidates, or the history of election outcomes) for that county in a separate panel.

0. Spend 10 minutes thinking about the components of this dashboard:
   - Where is the text on the page, and what does it describe?
   - What interactive UI components are useful for users (if any besides the map)?
   - What happens when a user selects a county on the map?
1. Choose a layout from https://www.mapuipatterns.com/
2. Create a mock up of the dashboard that includes the elements you've discussed.
