## Practice

In this exercise you'll build on the choropleth map that you created in the previous class. Imagine that the map is a part of a dashboard that you are creating for the commonwealth's election commission. They want users to be able to not just see the data on the map, but also to be able to click on a given county and see more detailed information about the election results for that county in a separate panel.

In the https://github.com/Weitzman-MUSA-JavaScript/pa-county-election-results repository under the layout-exercise branch you can see a mostly unstyled version of this. Check out this repository and update the layout of this page to:

1. on full screen monitors, have the map take up about 2/3 of the width of the screen and the details panel take up about 1/3 of the width of the screen. The details panel should be to the right of the map. (for an extra challenge, make the info panel "hover" over the map with space on the top, right, and bottom)
2. on smaller screens (e.g. tablets), have the map take up the full width, and half the height of the screen, with the details panel below it taking up the full width and half the height of the screen.
