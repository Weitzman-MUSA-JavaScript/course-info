## Practice

In this exercise you'll build on the choropleth map that you created in the previous class. Imagine that the map is a part of a dashboard that you are creating for the commonwealth's election commission. They want users to be able to not just see the data on the map, but also to be able to click on a given county and see more detailed information about the election results (such as a chart showing the distribution of votes for different candidates, or the history of election outcomes) for that county in a separate panel.

1. Choose a layout from https://www.mapuipatterns.com/
2. Create a mock up of the dashboard that includes the map and a panel that shows detailed information about the selected county.
